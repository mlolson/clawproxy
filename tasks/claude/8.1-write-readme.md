# ClawProxy

Secure credential injection for AI agents. Protect your API keys from prompt injection attacks.

## The Problem

AI agents need API credentials to call services, but:
- Storing keys in environment variables exposes them to prompt injection
- Agents can be tricked into revealing or exfiltrating credentials
- There's no isolation between the agent and sensitive secrets

## The Solution

ClawProxy provides:
- **Proxy**: Injects credentials into requests, agent never sees real keys
- **Sandbox**: Blocks agent from reading secret files on disk
- **Placeholder Tokens**: Agent uses `PROXY:openai` instead of real keys

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
brew install YOUR_ORG/clawproxy/clawproxy  # or use install script

# Initialize
clawproxy init

# Add your API keys
clawproxy secret set openai
clawproxy secret set anthropic

# Start proxy
clawproxy start

# Run your agent sandboxed
clawproxy-run ./my-agent
```

## How It Works

[ASCII diagram from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md]

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/clawproxy/config.yaml`:

```yaml
listen:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8080

services:
  openai:
    prefix: "/openai"
    upstream: "https://api.openai.com"
    secret: "openai"
    auth_header: "Authorization"
    auth_format: "Bearer {secret}"
```

## Security Model

| Attack | Protected? | How |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Agent reads secret files | ✓ | Sandbox blocks access |
| Prompt injection exfiltration | ✓ | Agent never has real keys |
| Agent logs auth headers | ✓ | Only sees PROXY:xxx |

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full threat model.

## Platform Support

| Feature | macOS 12+ | Linux 5.13+ | Older Linux |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Proxy | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Sandbox | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ Warning |

## OpenClaw Integration

```bash
clawproxy configure-openclaw
```
